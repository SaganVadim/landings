            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Service Information</strong>: We collect details of the
                surveillance systems you purchase, including your order history,
                payment information, and installation details. This ensures that
                we can offer efficient setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting
                support to meet your security needs.
              </li>

                <strong>Communication Logs</strong>: Every time you reach out to
                us—whether it's through email, phone, chat, or our customer
                service portal—we log these interactions. This helps us track
                issues, improve service quality, and ensure that we resolve your
                concerns promptly.

            <p>
              At AlertWatch, we take your security seriously. We implement
              industry-leading protocols to protect your personal information
              from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. While no
              online system can guarantee absolute security, we strive to apply
              cutting-edge practices that minimize risks and protect your data.
              To ensure the ongoing safety of your information, we have adopted
              several robust security measures, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Encryption</strong>: All sensitive data, such as payment
                information and personal details, are encrypted both during
                transmission and in storage. This ensures that your data remains
                protected from external threats and is only accessible to
                authorized personnel.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Secure Storage</strong>: Your data is housed in secure
                data centers equipped with stringent access controls, firewalls,
                and physical security measures. We limit access to authorized
                personnel only, further safeguarding your information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Regular Audits</strong>: To maintain the integrity of
                our systems, we conduct frequent security audits and
                vulnerability assessments. These regular checks allow us to
                identify any potential weaknesses and take corrective action
                swiftly.
              </li>
            </ul>
