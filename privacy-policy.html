                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                  Welcome to RentHive! Your privacy is crucial to us, and we are
                  dedicated to maintaining transparency and security as you
                  explore and use our office rental platform. We understand that
                  navigating the world of office rentals often involves sharing
                  personal and professional details, which is why we take your
                  privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we
                  collect, use, and protect your personal information while you
                  browse listings, make inquiries, or use our services to find
                  the ideal office space for your business needs. Our goal is to
                  ensure that every interaction you have with us is secure,
                  transparent, and designed to keep your information private. By
                  using our site, you agree to the practices described here, and
                  we will keep you informed about any changes that may affect
                  how your data is handled. RentHive values your trust, and
                  safeguarding your data is our top priority, allowing you to
                  focus on what truly mattersâ€”finding the right workspace.

                <h2>1. Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                  RentHive employs advanced security measures to protect your
                  personal data. We understand that the modern digital landscape
                  poses a variety of risks to sensitive information, and we are
                  committed to staying ahead of those threats. To ensure your
                  data remains safe, we use encryption technologies to shield
                  your information during transmission and store it on secure
                  servers with robust firewalls. Additionally, our team conducts
                  frequent security audits and system updates to stay ahead of
                  emerging cybersecurity threats. Whether you're uploading
                  documents, entering personal information, or simply browsing
                  available properties, rest assured that we have taken every
                  step to safeguard your data. We also monitor our systems for
                  potential vulnerabilities and unauthorized access attempts,
                  allowing us to respond swiftly and effectively to any
                  suspicious activity. Your peace of mind is our priority, and
                  we work diligently to ensure that your data is always
                  protected from unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse.
                </p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2>2. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>
                  We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to
                  fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, such as
                  helping you find the right office space or responding to
                  inquiries about specific properties. Our data retention
                  practices are designed with privacy and security in mind,
                  ensuring that we do not store any information longer than
                  required by law or for the operation of our services. Once
                  your data is no longer needed, we ensure its secure disposal
                  through data deletion or anonymization processes, where all
                  personal identifiers are removed, making it impossible to
                  trace the data back to you. Whether you are using our platform
                  to search for a rental, communicate with property managers, or
                  simply inquire about available spaces, you can trust that we
                  handle your data responsibly. We understand that unnecessary
                  data retention can pose risks, and our goal is to minimize any
                  potential exposure by deleting or anonymizing data once it is
                  no longer necessary. Our commitment to responsible data
                  management is part of our broader mission to provide a secure,
                  reliable platform for all our users.

                <h2>3. Access Control</h2>
                <p>
                  Access to your personal information is limited to authorized
                  personnel at RentHive who need it to perform their duties. We
                  implement a strict access control framework to ensure that
                  only individuals with the appropriate clearance can view or
                  modify your data. Role-based access controls are used to
                  prevent unnecessary access to sensitive information, with each
                  team member granted access only to the data necessary for
                  their specific responsibilities. This not only helps safeguard
                  your privacy but also ensures the integrity of our internal
                  data handling processes. We review access rights regularly,
                  ensuring that employees and contractors only maintain access
                  to your data for as long as necessary. In addition to
                  technical controls, our staff undergoes frequent training on
                  data protection best practices, and we foster a culture of
                  responsibility when it comes to handling your personal
                  information. By limiting access to essential personnel and
                  constantly monitoring access levels, we significantly reduce
                  the risk of data breaches or unauthorized handling within our
                  organization. Our access control policies are at the heart of
                  our approach to maintaining your trust.

                <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>
                  While RentHive takes every precaution to protect your data,
                  our site may contain links to third-party websites, such as
                  external property listings, payment services, or additional
                  resources related to office rentals. These third-party
                  services operate independently of RentHive, and their privacy
                  practices may differ from ours. Once you leave our platform to
                  visit these third-party websites, you will be subject to their
                  privacy policies, not ours. We strongly encourage you to
                  review the privacy practices of any third-party site before
                  providing them with personal information, as we cannot control
                  or be held responsible for how they manage or use your data.
                  Although we take extensive measures to ensure your data is
                  secure on our platform, protecting your information when
                  engaging with external services is your responsibility. That
                  said, we only partner with trusted service providers, and we
                  strive to work with third parties who share our commitment to
                  privacy and data protection. By staying informed and vigilant,
                  you can help ensure that your data remains safe no matter
                  where you interact online.

                <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                  To enhance your experience on RentHive, we use cookies and
                  tracking technologies to understand how you interact with our
                  platform. Cookies are small data files stored on your device
                  that help us remember your preferences, track usage patterns,

                  cookies enable us to remember your search filters when looking
                  for office spaces, so you don't have to re-enter them each
                  time you visit. They also help us optimize our site's
                  functionality, ensuring faster load times and smoother
                  navigation. These tracking technologies provide valuable
                  insights into how users interact with our platform, allowing
                  us to make improvements and deliver a more efficient,
                  user-friendly service. You have the option to control your
                  cookie settings through your browser, and you can disable
                  cookies if desired. However, please note that disabling
                  cookies may affect your ability to use certain features on our
                  site, such as saving searches or accessing personalized
