              <p>
                Welcome to PicnicPal, your trusted companion for all things BBQ
                and picnics! Whether you're planning a backyard barbecue with
                friends or a cozy picnic with family, we want you to know that
                your privacy is incredibly important to us. We are fully
                committed to protecting your personal information and ensuring
                that your data is treated with the respect it deserves. This
                Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your
                data so that you can enjoy our services with peace of mind,
                knowing that your trust is at the heart of everything we do.
              </p>

              <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>
                We believe in simplicity and transparency when it comes to your
                data. The personal information we collect is only what you
                voluntarily provide to us, such as your name, email address,
                phone number, and other details that help us serve you better.
                For instance, you might provide this information when you create
                an account, place an order, or reach out to our customer
                support. We do not engage in invasive data collection practices,
                meaning we don’t use cookies or track your online behavior
                unless absolutely necessary for delivering our services. Our
                goal is to gather only the information that enhances your
                experience with PicnicPal, ensuring your journey with us is both
                enjoyable and private.
              </p>

              <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
              <p>
                The information you share with us plays a vital role in
                delivering a smooth and personalized experience. Whether it’s
                processing your orders efficiently, ensuring fast and accurate
                delivery, or providing tailored product recommendations, your
                data allows us to make every interaction with PicnicPal special.
                Additionally, with your permission, we may use your email or
                contact details to send you updates, promotional offers, or
                special discounts on BBQ gear and picnic essentials. We
                understand that your inbox is valuable space, which is why we
                only send relevant communications that align with your
                interests. And of course, you can opt out of these updates at
                any time, giving you full control over the information you
                receive.
              </p>

              <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
              <p>
                At PicnicPal, we treat your data with the highest level of
                confidentiality. We may share your information with trusted
                third-party service providers who assist us in delivering key
                aspects of our services, such as payment processors, delivery
                services, and marketing platforms. These partners are carefully
                selected and contractually obligated to protect your information
                and use it solely for the purposes that we outline. They are
                prohibited from using your data for any unauthorized activities.
                Additionally, in rare instances, we may be required to disclose
                your information due to legal obligations, such as compliance
                with court orders or legal investigations. Should our company
                undergo any major changes, such as a merger or acquisition, we
                will ensure that your data remains protected and that any
                transitions are handled responsibly.
              </p>

              <h2>Security and Data Retention</h2>
              <p>
                Your security is a top priority for us. We employ a variety of
                technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal
                information from unauthorized access, alteration, or loss. This
                includes data encryption, secure servers, and regular security
                audits to ensure that your information is handled with care.
                Only authorized personnel who are thoroughly trained in data
                protection have access to your information, and we continuously
                monitor our systems for potential threats. We retain your data
                only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined
                in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. When your data is
                no longer needed, we ensure that it is either securely deleted
                or anonymized, ensuring that your privacy is always maintained.
              </p>

              <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
              <p>
                PicnicPal’s services are designed for individuals aged 18 and
                older. We understand the importance of protecting children’s
                privacy, which is why we do not knowingly collect any personal
                information from children under the age of 13. If we become
                aware that we have inadvertently gathered information from a
                minor, we will take immediate steps to remove it from our
                system. Our commitment to a safe and secure environment extends
                to all our users, and we appreciate your vigilance in helping us
                maintain these standards. If you believe that a child’s
                information may have been collected, please contact us
                immediately so we can take corrective action and ensure
                compliance with all relevant privacy laws.
              </p>

                requirements. Our commitment to transparency means that any
                updates will be clearly communicated on our website, and we
                encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay
                informed about how we protect your data. Continued use of our
