                LeatherLine does not retain personal data longer than necessary.
                Our data retention policy is clear: any temporary information
                collected, such as during the purchase process, is promptly
                deleted once it’s no longer needed. We believe in minimizing
                data collection to only what is absolutely essential, and once
                that information has served its purpose, it is removed from our
                systems. This approach ensures that your privacy is respected
                and that we are not holding onto unnecessary data. By adhering
                to this practice, we aim to maintain a high level of trust with
                our customers, ensuring that your data is handled with integrity
                and care at every step.
