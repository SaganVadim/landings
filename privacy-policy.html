                <h3>We Care About Your Data</h3>
                <p>
                  At Nailicious, we believe that your personal information is
                  just that—personal. Whether you're booking your next manicure
                  or leaving feedback, we handle your details with the respect
                  they deserve. We’re committed to making sure that your privacy
                  is protected at all times. We don’t just follow the rules—we
                  go above and beyond to ensure that your experience is safe and
                  secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also take extra precautions when it comes to minors. If
                  you're under 18, we ask that you refrain from sharing any
                  personal information with us. And if we accidentally collect
                  such data, rest assured that it will be immediately deleted.
                  Your safety and privacy are our priorities.
