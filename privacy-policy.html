              <p>
                Welcome to Yardz's Privacy Policy. We take your privacy very
                seriously and are fully committed to protecting any personal
                information you share with us. This policy explains in detail
                how we collect, use, and safeguard the data you provide when
                visiting our website or purchasing products from our store. By
                continuing to use our site, you agree to the terms set out in
                this policy, and we assure you that we will handle your
                information with the utmost care and responsibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note, this Privacy Policy applies only to the information
                collected directly through our website. It does not cover
                external websites or third-party services that may be linked
                from our pages. We encourage you to review the privacy practices
                of these external sites before sharing any personal information
                with them. Staying informed about how your data is handled
                across different platforms is essential to maintaining your
                privacy.
              </p>
              <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>
                At Yardz, we collect only the necessary information you choose
                to provide. This may include your name, email address, shipping
                information, and payment details when you make a purchase or
                subscribe to our newsletter. We may also gather non-personal
                information, such as your browsing behavior on our site, to help
                us understand how we can improve your experience. Rest assured,
                we do not collect any sensitive information without your
                explicit consent.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, we may use cookies to enhance your browsing
                experience. Cookies allow us to remember your preferences and
                help you navigate the site more efficiently. However, you have
                the option to disable cookies in your browser settings if you
                prefer not to use them. We always strive to respect your choices
                and provide transparency regarding the data we collect.
              </p>
              <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
              <p>
                The information we collect is used to process your orders,
                provide customer support, and keep you informed about new
                products, promotions, or updates related to Yardz. We may also
                use your data to improve our website functionality, ensuring
                that your experience is as smooth and enjoyable as possible.
                Occasionally, we may send out marketing communications, but only
                with your permission.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will never sell, rent, or share your personal information
                with third parties for marketing purposes. The only exception to
                this rule is when sharing information with trusted partners,
                such as payment processors or shipping companies, to complete
                transactions. These partners are required to adhere to strict
                confidentiality agreements and use your data solely for the
                purposes of completing your order.
              </p>
              <h2>How We Secure Your Information</h2>
              <p>
                Keeping your information safe is a top priority at Yardz. We
                employ industry-standard security measures, including data
                encryption, secure servers, and access controls, to protect your
                personal data from unauthorized access, misuse, or loss. Our
                team regularly reviews our security practices to ensure they are
                up-to-date with the latest technologies and threats.
              </p>
              <p>
                While we make every effort to protect your information, it is
                important to understand that no method of online data
                transmission or storage is completely secure. As a result, we
                cannot guarantee absolute security. However, we are continuously
                improving our security protocols to ensure that your personal
                data is as safe as possible.
              </p>
              <h2>Links to External Websites</h2>
              <p>
                For your convenience, our website may contain links to external
                websites or services, including social media platforms,
                affiliate sites, or third-party service providers. Although we
                carefully select these links, Yardz is not responsible for the
                content or privacy practices of these external websites. Each
                site may have its own privacy policy, and we recommend reviewing
                those policies before interacting with or providing any personal
                information to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, once you leave our website and access an external
                link, your interactions are governed by the privacy policies of
                that site. We encourage you to be vigilant and make sure you
                understand how your information is being collected and used on
                any site you visit.
              </p>
              <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
              <p>
                Yardz is not intended for use by individuals under the age of
                13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from
                children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received
                information from a child under 13 without verifiable parental
                consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information
                from our records.
              </p>
              <p>
                We strongly encourage parents and guardians to monitor their
                children's online activities to ensure their safety. If you
                believe that your child has provided personal information to
                Yardz without your consent, please contact us immediately, and
                we will take the necessary actions to resolve the issue.
              </p>
              <h2>Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p>
                We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect
                changes in our practices, legal requirements, or industry
                standards. When we make updates, we will update the "Last
                Updated" date at the top of this policy. Any changes will take
                effect as soon as they are posted on our site.
              </p>
              <p>
                We encourage you to review this policy regularly to stay
                informed about how we are protecting your personal information.
                By continuing to use Yardz’s services after any changes, you are
                agreeing to the updated terms. If you have any concerns about
                these changes, please feel free to contact us for clarification.
              </p>
              <h2>Your Consent</h2>
              <p>
                By using Yardz’s website and services, you consent to the
                collection and use of your information as described in this
                Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any aspect of this
                policy, please refrain from using our site or services. Your
                continued use of the site after updates to the policy signifies
                your acceptance of the new terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe in clear communication and are dedicated to keeping
                you informed about how we handle your data. If you have any
                questions or need further information, do not hesitate to reach

              </p>
              <h2>Governing Law</h2>
              <p>
                This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction
                in which Yardz operates. By accessing our site, you agree to
                these laws and the transfer of your data to our servers, located
                in the same jurisdiction. Our practices are designed to comply
                with all applicable laws and regulations, and we strive to meet
                or exceed legal privacy standards in every aspect of our
                business.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are accessing our site from outside this jurisdiction,
                please be aware that your information will be transferred to,
                processed, and stored in the location where Yardz operates. By
                using our website, you consent to this transfer and processing.
              </p>
              <h2>Data Security</h2>
              <p>
                Yardz implements a range of security measures to protect your
                personal information from unauthorized access, misuse, or
                disclosure. These include firewalls, encryption, and secure data
                storage systems. Access to personal information is restricted to
                authorized personnel who need the data to perform specific
                tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                While we take strong precautions to secure your information, no
                online system can guarantee absolute protection. As threats
                evolve, we are continually reviewing and upgrading our security
                systems to minimize risks. We encourage you to use strong
                passwords and be cautious about sharing your personal details
                online.
              </p>
              <h2>Retention of Information</h2>
              <p>
                We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill
                the purposes for which it was collected, such as processing
                orders or providing customer service. In some cases, we may
                retain information for longer periods if required by law or to
                comply with our legal obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                When your information is no longer needed, we will securely
                delete or anonymize it. Our data retention policies are
                regularly reviewed to ensure they comply with legal requirements
                and best practices for privacy protection.
              </p>
              <h2>International Users</h2>
              <p>
                Our website is based in the jurisdiction where Yardz operates.
                If you are accessing our site from outside this region, your
                data may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the region
                where we are located. We take all reasonable steps to ensure
                that your information is handled securely, regardless of where
                it is processed.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using our website, you consent to the transfer and processing
                of your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, even if you
                are located in a different jurisdiction.
              </p>
              <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
              <p>
                Yardz may use third-party services, such as payment processors
                or analytics tools, to help us provide the best experience for
                our customers. These third-party providers have their own
                privacy policies and practices, which we encourage you to
                review. Yardz works only with reputable providers that adhere to
                strong privacy standards.
              </p>
              <p>
                While we take care to partner with trustworthy service
                providers, we cannot be held responsible for their actions. It’s
                always a good idea to familiarize yourself with their privacy
                practices, especially when sharing sensitive information.
              </p>
              <h2>Opt-Out and Unsubscribe</h2>
              <p>
                We understand that your preferences may change over time. That’s
                why we offer an easy way to opt out of receiving our marketing
                communications. You can unsubscribe from our newsletters or
                promotional emails at any time by following the unsubscribe link
                in the email or contacting us directly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once we receive your request, we will promptly update your
                preferences and ensure that you no longer receive marketing
                communications. However, we may still need to send you important
                transactional emails, such as order confirmations or shipping
                updates.
              </p>
