                <h3>Protecting the Secrets of Young Readers</h3>
                <p>
                  At NovelNook, we cherish the privacy of our young book
                  enthusiasts. We are devoted to ensuring that no personal
                  information is gathered from individuals under the age of 18.
                  If you are under this age, please avoid sharing any personal
                  details with us. Should we inadvertently collect information
                  from someone underage without proper parental consent, we will
                  swiftly remove it from our records.
