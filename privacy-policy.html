                  <p>
                    Confidentiality is a cornerstone of FitXcel’s values and
                    operations. We understand the trust you place in us when
                    using our services, and we take this responsibility very
                    seriously. Whether you are booking a fitness class,
                    purchasing training programs, or seeking online support, we
                    handle all interactions with the utmost discretion. Our
                    commitment to confidentiality is reinforced by our adherence
                    to industry best practices and ethical guidelines. We
                    regularly review our confidentiality protocols to safeguard
                    your information and ensure it is never shared without your
                    explicit consent. In the rare event that we are legally
                    required to disclose information, we will do so
                    transparently and only after exhausting all options to
                    protect your privacy. Confidentiality is not just a service
                    offering but a fundamental aspect of our relationship with
                    you, our valued client.

                  <p>
                    Data security is a crucial element of FitXcel’s privacy
                    commitment. Although we strive to limit personal data
                    collection, we recognize the importance of robust security
                    measures to protect any information transmitted through our
                    platform. We employ advanced encryption protocols to
                    safeguard your data during transactions and conduct regular
                    updates to our security systems to address emerging threats.
                    Our security framework includes routine audits and ongoing
                    staff training to ensure that we meet or exceed industry
                    standards. Access controls are strictly maintained to
                    prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing sensitive
                    information. Should any data security incident occur, we
                    have a comprehensive incident response plan in place to
                    address the situation promptly and transparently, minimizing
                    any potential impact on you.

                    services to enhance the quality and scope of our offerings.
                    We carefully select these partners to ensure they adhere to

                    their compliance regularly to ensure that they meet our high
                    standards. Importantly, we do not share or sell customer
                    information to third parties for marketing purposes. Our aim
                    is to maintain control over your data and use it solely to
                    improve your experience with FitXcel. If we need to work
                    with a new service provider, we conduct a thorough
                    evaluation to ensure they align with our privacy and
                    security requirements before initiating any collaboration.

                    Protecting the privacy of younger users is a priority for
                    FitXcel. Our services are intended for individuals aged 18
                    and older, and we do not knowingly offer rentals or other
                    services to children under 13. We implement measures to
                    prevent the collection of data from children and take
                    immediate action to delete any such information if we become
                    aware that it has been collected inadvertently. We encourage
                    parents and guardians to monitor their children’s online
                    activities and to reach out to us if they believe their
                    child has interacted with our platform. FitXcel is committed
                    to providing a safe and respectful environment for all users
                    and will continuously refine our practices to ensure the
                    protection of children’s privacy.
