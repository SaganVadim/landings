                <h3>Securing Our Customers' Trust</h3>
                <p>
                  At MoveOn, we understand the importance of your privacy. We
                  are dedicated to handling every piece of personal information
                  you share with us with the utmost care and respect, especially
                  for our younger customers under the age of 18. We strictly
                  avoid collecting data from minors without parental consent and
                  promptly eliminate any such data accidentally gathered. Our
                  team and third-party providers are instructed to handle
                  personal information only as necessary for delivering our
                  services, conditional upon obtaining explicit consent from the
                  information's owner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upholding your privacy is a key aspect of our commitment to
                  delivering outstanding service and support. We refrain from
                  developing data-processing operations for commercial uses
                  unless specifically requested. Upon soliciting personal
                  information, comprehensive details regarding the use and
                  processing reasons are provided. Where consent is a
                  prerequisite, your acknowledgment of our privacy safeguards is
                  greatly valued.

                  quality services or as long as required by law. The criteria
                  for our retention periods include data sensitivity, the risk

                  through other means, all the while prioritizing your privacy.

                  As MoveOn serves a global clientele, your personal information
                  may be processed outside your home country. Nonetheless, we
                  guarantee the same level of data protection regardless of

                  security protocols and making sure that international data
                  processing aligns with our rigorous privacy policy standards.
                  MoveOn complies with global privacy regulations, such as the

                  uphold similar privacy standards, treating your information
                  with respect and dignity. In doing so, your personal data
                  receives consistent protection, regardless of the processing
                  location.
