              <h1>Privacy Policy of WheelHire Bike Rentals</h1>
              <p>
                At WheelHire Bike Rentals, we believe that the privacy of our
                customers is fundamental. We value the trust placed in us and
                strive to protect your personal information, ensuring its
                security and confidentiality. This Privacy Policy describes how
                we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information
                when you access our website and use our services. Please read
                this Privacy Policy carefully to better understand our practices
                and how we use your information.
              </p>
              <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
              <p>
                To provide our products and services, we may request personal
                information such as your name, email address, residential
                address, and payment information. This information is necessary
                to process your rentals, ensure the proper delivery of the
                bikes, and provide exceptional customer support. Additionally,
                we may also collect non-personal information such as demographic
                data and purchase preferences to enhance our market
                understanding and further personalize your experience with us.
              </p>
              <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
              <p>
                The personal information you provide to us is used solely for
                the purpose of processing your rentals, offering support and
                assistance, sending relevant information about promotions and
                product updates, and promptly addressing any inquiries or
                requests you may have. We utilize non-personal information for
                market analysis, product improvements, and customizing the user
                experience. It is important to emphasize that we hold your
                privacy in high regard, and we do not share, sell, or rent your
                personal information to any third parties, except when necessary
                to fulfill legal obligations or facilitate rental-related
                transactions, such as payment processing and bike delivery.
              </p>
              <h2>3. Protection of Information</h2>
              <p>
                We are fully committed to ensuring the utmost security and
                integrity of your personal information. We employ robust
                technical and organizational measures to protect your data from
                unauthorized access, misuse, alteration, or disclosure. Our
                stringent security protocols, encryption mechanisms, and
                firewalls are designed to safeguard your information against
                unauthorized access. Furthermore, access to your information is
                strictly limited to authorized personnel who require it to
                perform their job responsibilities. Although no system can
                provide 100% security, we continuously strive to enhance and
                update our security protocols to ensure the continuous
                protection of your information.
