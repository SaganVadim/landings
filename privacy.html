                <h3>Safeguarding the Privacy of Future Chefs</h3>
                <p>
                  Here at ChefsTable, we understand and highly value the privacy
                  of young, aspiring chefs. We take meticulous care not to
                  knowingly accumulate any personal information from individuals
                  under the age of 18 years. If you are under the age specified,
                  we kindly ask you to refrain from providing any personal
                  details. In the event we come across information collected
                  from a minor without valid consent from their parents, we
                  pledge to delete such information from our servers promptly.
                </p>

                <h3>Storage, Retention, and Protection of Your Information</h3>
                <p>
                  We establish, maintain, and adroitly manage your personal data
                  only for necessary durations to fulfill the purposes explained
                  in our Privacy Commitment, and as necessitated by the law. The
                  duration for which we retain the data is carefully considered
                  - the nature, sensitivity, and the extent of potential risk
                  from unauthorized use or disclosure of the data inform this
                  duration. When considering the legal requirements, the
                  purposes we're processing your information for, and the
                  possibility of delivering these objectives through other
                  means, your information's protection is our priority at every
                  step. We are committed to ensure the confidentiality and
                  security of your personal information.

                <h3>International Transfers and Processing of Information</h3>
                <p>
                  In an increasingly globalized world, the information you
                  provide may be processed and stored in a different
                  jurisdiction to your location, which might have different
                  privacy regulations. ChefsTable conforms rigorously to this
                  Privacy Commitment and to applicable laws when your data is
                  transferred across borders. We implement robust safeguards to
                  ensure your personal details remain secure irrespective of
                  which jurisdiction they fall in.

                <p>
                  At ChefsTable, we understand that data protection norms are
                  dynamic and may evolve over time. Accordingly, we may review

                  these changes. We will notify about such changes by posting

                  stay informed. Your continued use of our services conforms

                <p>
                  Here at ChefsTable, we are steadfastly committed to the
                  ethical and lawful processing of your personal information. We
                  adhere strictly to relevant data protection laws while
                  collecting and processing your information. The reasons for
                  this collection and processing are numerous, including
                  providing and honing our services, managing user accounts,
                  dispatching administrative updates, customizing user
                  experiences, constructing insightful analytics, and
                  maintaining effective communication with you. We ensure that
                  personal data processing is scrupulous and carried out as per
                  regulatory provisions and only for legitimate and necessary
                  purposes.

                  Information
                </h3>
                <p>
                  We may share your personal data with third-party service
                  providers, affiliates, or trusted partners to facilitate the
                  provision of our services, including dispatching class
                  schedules, undertaking payment processing, data analysis,
                  communication, and providing user support. We are judicious
                  about who we partner with, basing these relationships on the
                  other entities' commitment to uphold and value your privacy.
                  We furnish them with only as much information as would be
                  necessary to deliver their services to you. Selling your
                  personal data or renting it out for profits is strictly
                  against our ethos.
