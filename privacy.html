              <p>
                Welcome to SereneSpa's Privacy Policy. We are dedicated to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the comprehensive details on how we handle the information we collect when you visit our website and use our services. By using any of our services, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Our commitment to your privacy is unwavering, and we aim to provide complete transparency about our privacy practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information collected through third-party services, websites, or applications that may be accessed through our website. These third-party services may have their own privacy practices, and we strongly encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing them with your personal information. Understanding the privacy practices of any service you use is essential to ensuring your information is handled according to your expectations.
              </p>
              <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
              <p>
                At SereneSpa, we prioritize your privacy by not collecting or storing any personal information from our website visitors unless it is voluntarily provided to us, such as through a contact form or email subscription. We respect your right to browse our website without any tracking or data collection. We do not use cookies, web beacons, or any other tracking technologies to gather information about your browsing habits or personal preferences. Our approach ensures that your online experience remains private and secure.

              <h2>How We Use the Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
              <p>
                Since we do not collect personal information from our website visitors, we do not use such information for any purpose. We do not engage in activities such as data mining, profiling, or targeted advertising. Our primary focus is on providing a seamless and enjoyable experience for our users without compromising their privacy. Furthermore, we do not share, sell, or rent any personal information to third parties for marketing or any other purposes, ensuring that your privacy is maintained at all times.
              </p>
              <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
              <p>
                We take reasonable measures to protect any personal information that we may receive from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Our security protocols include encryption, secure servers, and regular security audits to ensure that your information remains safe. However, it is important to note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We continuously review and enhance our security measures to protect your data to the best of our ability.
              </p>
