            <p>
              At TinyTreasures Toy Store, we prioritize the privacy and security
              of our customers' personal information. We understand the
              importance of protecting your privacy and are committed to
              ensuring that your information remains confidential and secure.
              This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and
              safeguard your information when you visit our website and use our
              services. Please take a moment to review this Privacy Policy to
              understand our practices and how we handle your information.
            </p>
            <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
            <p>
              To provide you with our range of toys and services, we may collect
              personal information such as your name, email address, shipping
              address, and payment details. This information is necessary for
              processing your orders, ensuring accurate delivery, and providing
              customer support. Additionally, we may collect non-personal
              information such as demographic data and browsing behavior to
              enhance our services and tailor your experience with us. Our
              commitment to protecting your personal information is paramount,
              and we adhere to stringent data protection standards to ensure
              that your information is kept safe and secure at all times.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
            <p>
              The personal information you provide enables us to fulfill your
              orders, offer support, communicate updates about products and
              promotions, and respond to your inquiries effectively.
              Non-personal information helps us analyze trends, improve our
              website functionality, and personalize your shopping experience.
              We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third
              parties, except as required to fulfill legal obligations or
              facilitate services like payment processing and shipping. Your
              trust is essential to us, and we are committed to maintaining the
              confidentiality of your information through strict internal
              policies and technological safeguards.

            <p>
              We employ robust security measures to protect your personal
              information from unauthorized access, misuse, or alteration. Our
              security protocols include encryption, firewalls, and restricted
              access to your data. While no method is completely foolproof, we
              continually update our security practices to maintain the
              integrity and confidentiality of your information. We regularly
              review our security policies and procedures to ensure they meet
              industry standards and regulatory requirements, providing you with
              peace of mind regarding the safety of your data.
