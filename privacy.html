                  Recognizing the special considerations for our clients'
                  diverse family members, we take extra precautions with any
                  information related to pet owners and their pets, especially

                  policies consider the need for sensitivity, the potential
                  risks involved, and the possibility of fulfilling these needs
                  by other means with your privacy taking precedence. Our
                  protective strategies include:
