We do not use cookies or any other tracking technologies to collect information about your online activities.
    </p>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        We use the information we collect to provide and improve our services, respond to your inquiries, and send you administrative communications.

    <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        We may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, and customer service. These service providers are required to keep your information confidential and are prohibited from using it for any purpose other than providing the services for which they were hired. We may also disclose your information as required by law or in response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena.

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no security measures can guarantee 100% protection, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You transmit all information at your own risk.
    </p>
