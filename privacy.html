              <p>
                Welcome to AntiqueAid, your premier destination for expert
                antique restoration and repair services. We are dedicated to
                safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your personal
                information is managed with the utmost care. This Privacy Policy
                outlines our practices related to the collection, use, and
                disclosure of your information in connection with our services.
                We emphasize transparency and accountability in how we handle
                your data to maintain your trust.
              </p>

              <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>
                We collect personal information solely that you voluntarily
                provide to us. This may encompass your name, email address,
                phone number, and other details you choose to share. For
                instance, when you register an account, place an order, or reach
                out to our support team, you may supply such information. We do
                not use cookies or similar tracking technologies to gather data
                on your online behavior. Our commitment to privacy means we only
                collect data necessary for delivering our services and enhancing
                your experience. We have implemented rigorous measures to
                protect your personal information.
              </p>

              <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
              <p>
                The information we gather is used to deliver and enhance our
                services, respond to your requests, and communicate relevant
                information to you. For example, your data helps us process
                orders efficiently and ensure accurate delivery. We may also use
                your details to personalize your experience, offering
                recommendations based on your preferences and past interactions.
                With your consent, we might send you promotional offers, special
                discounts, and informative updates. You can opt-out of these
                communications at any time, giving you control over the
                information you receive from us.
              </p>

              <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
              <p>
                We may disclose your information to select third-party service
                providers who assist us in delivering our services. This
                includes entities like payment processors, shipping services,
                email marketing platforms, and data analytics providers. These
                partners help us operate efficiently and effectively. They are
                contractually bound to protect your information and cannot use
                it for unauthorized purposes. Additionally, we may share your
                information if legally required or during corporate transactions
                such as mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales, ensuring your
                data remains protected.
              </p>

              <h2>Security and Data Retention</h2>
              <p>
                We prioritize the security of your personal information by
                implementing robust technical and organizational safeguards to
                prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Our security
                measures include data encryption, regular updates to security
                protocols, and thorough audits. Your data is stored securely on
                encrypted servers with access restricted to authorized personnel
                only, who are trained to handle data responsibly. We retain your
                information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
                outlined in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. Once it
                is no longer needed, it is securely deleted or anonymized.
              </p>

              <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
              <p>
                You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal
                information at any time. We provide straightforward methods for
                managing your data. If you wish to exercise these rights or have
                any questions or concerns about your privacy or data protection,

                You can also manage your communication preferences and opt out
                of marketing messages by following the instructions provided in
                our emails, ensuring you only receive information that is
                relevant to you.

              <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
              <p>

                do not knowingly collect personal information from children
                under 13. We strive to maintain a secure environment and take
                measures to avoid collecting data from younger users. If we
                discover that we have inadvertently collected information from a
                child, we will promptly remove it from our records. If you
                believe we may have collected information from a child, please
                contact us immediately so we can take appropriate action and
                comply with privacy regulations.
              </p>
