                    <p>
                      LightPainter is committed to protecting the privacy of
                      minors. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal
                      information from individuals under the age of 18. If you
                      are under 18, please do not attempt to register for our
                      services or provide any personal information about
                      yourself to us. If we discover that we have collected
                      personal information from a minor without parental
                      consent, we will take prompt steps to delete such
                      information from our records.

                    <p>
                      We retain your personal information for as long as
                      necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy
                      Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or
                      permitted by law. When determining the appropriate
                      retention period, we take into account the nature and
                      sensitivity of the personal information, the potential
                      risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
                      personal information, the purposes for which we process
                      your personal information, and whether we can achieve
                      those purposes through other means.

                      Your personal information may be transferred to, and
                      processed in, countries other than the country in which
                      you are located. These countries may have data protection
                      laws that are different from those of your country. When
                      we transfer your personal information to other countries,
                      we will protect that information as described in this
                      Privacy Policy and in compliance with applicable laws.

                      data necessary for the provision of services. We do not

                    <h3>Security Measures</h3>
                    <p>
                      LightPainter implements technical and organizational
                      security measures to protect personal data from
                      unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
                      destruction. We employ encryption, access controls,
                      firewalls, and other security protocols to safeguard
                      personal data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our security measures are regularly reviewed and updated
                      to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities. We
                      provide training and guidance to our staff to ensure
                      compliance with security policies and procedures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Despite our efforts to secure personal data, no method of
                      transmission over the internet or electronic storage is
                      100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect
                      personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
