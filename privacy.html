                <h3>Protecting Our Riders' Information</h3>
                <p>
                  At SpinStation, we recognize the importance of privacy for all
                  our riders. We are committed to responsibly handling the
                  personal information of every individual who uses our
                  services, especially those under the age of 18. We do not
                  knowingly collect personal data from minors and urge them not
                  to submit any personal details. If such information is
                  accidentally gathered without appropriate parental consent, it
                  will be deleted from our records without delay.
                </p>

                <h3>Data Retention and Security</h3>
                <p>
                  The personal information you trust us with is managed with the
                  utmost care. SpinStation retains this data for as long as it
                  is necessary to provide the excellent service you expect from
                  us, or as the law requires. Our retention periods consider the
                  nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk
                  from unauthorized use or disclosure, and whether we can
                  achieve those purposes through other means while ensuring your
                  privacy. We employ physical, technical, and administrative
                  measures to safeguard your information:

                  travels. This includes enforcing effective safeguards and
