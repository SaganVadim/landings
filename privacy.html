              <p>
                Welcome to TailorTrove's Privacy Policy. We are committed to
                safeguarding your personal information and respecting your
                privacy. This Privacy Policy provides a detailed account of how
                we handle the information collected when you visit our website
                and utilize our services. By using our services, you agree to
                the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. We pledge to be
                transparent about our privacy practices and prioritize your
                privacy at all times.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not cover
                information collected through third-party services, websites, or
                applications linked from our site. These third-party services
                have their own privacy policies, and we strongly recommend
                reviewing them before sharing any personal information. Being
                informed about the privacy practices of these external services
                helps ensure your data is handled according to your
                expectations.
              </p>
              <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
              <p>
                At TailorTrove, we respect your privacy by not collecting or
                retaining any personal information from our website visitors
                unless it is voluntarily provided, such as through a contact
                form or email subscription. We do not track your browsing
                activity or preferences. No cookies, web beacons, or other
                tracking technologies are used on our site. Our commitment is to
                maintain your browsing experience as private and secure as
                possible.
              </p>
              <h2>Usage of Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
              <p>
                Since we do not gather personal information from our visitors,
                there is no usage of such data. We refrain from practices such
                as data mining, profiling, or targeted marketing. Our primary
                aim is to offer a seamless and enjoyable experience while
                ensuring your privacy is never compromised. Additionally, we do
                not share, sell, or lease any personal information to third
                parties, safeguarding your privacy at all times.
              </p>
              <h2>How We Secure Your Information</h2>
              <p>
                We take appropriate steps to protect any personal information we
                might receive from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Our
                security measures include encryption, secure servers, and
                routine security reviews to ensure your data is well-protected.
                However, please note that no method of online transmission or
                storage is entirely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute
                security. We continuously update our security practices to
                enhance data protection.
              </p>
              <h2>Links to External Websites</h2>
              <p>
                Our site may contain links to external websites, including
                social media platforms, affiliate sites, or service providers
                with their own privacy policies. These links are provided for
                your convenience. We are not responsible for the content or
                privacy practices of these external sites. We encourage you to
                review the privacy policies of any third-party websites before
                sharing your personal information with them. Your interactions
                with these external sites are governed by their respective
                privacy policies.
              </p>
              <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
              <p>
                Our website is not intended for individuals under 13 years of
                age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
                children under 13. If we discover that we have inadvertently
                collected information from a child under 13, we will promptly
                take steps to remove such information from our records.
                Protecting children's privacy is a priority for us, and we urge
                parents and guardians to oversee their children's online
                activities to ensure their safety.
              </p>
              <h2>Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p>
                We may periodically update this Privacy Policy to reflect
                changes in our practices, technologies, legal obligations, or
                other factors. The updated policy will be indicated by a revised
                "Last Updated" date and will take effect as soon as it is
                published. We recommend reviewing this Privacy Policy regularly
                to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
                Continued use of our website and services following any changes
                constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
              </p>
              <h2>Your Consent</h2>
              <p>

                disagree with any part of this policy, please refrain from using
                our site. It is important to us that you understand and agree to
                our privacy terms. Continued use of the website after policy
                changes will signify your acceptance of those changes. We are

              </p>

                This Privacy Policy and TailorTrove's privacy practices are
                governed exclusively by the laws of the jurisdiction in which we
                operate. If you access our website from outside this

              <h2>Data Security</h2>
              <p>
                We implement administrative, technical, and physical security
                measures to protect your personal data. These measures include
                firewalls, encryption, and access controls. While we have taken
                reasonable steps to secure the information you provide, please
                be aware that no security measures are entirely foolproof, and
                no data transmission method can be completely safeguarded
                against interception or misuse. We remain committed to enhancing
                our security protocols to protect your data.
              </p>
              <h2>Retention of Information</h2>

                fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or as required by
                law. Our data retention policies ensure that information is kept
                only as long as needed for service provision or legal
                compliance. We regularly review our data retention practices to
                ensure they align with legal requirements and regulations.
