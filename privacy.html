                At HappyHearts, safeguarding your child’s personal details isn't

                that our clients' experiences hinge not only on the delight
                their children find in our toys but also on the assurance that
                their personal data remains confidential. That's why we've
                deployed stringent security measures to protect the information
                shared with us. From the moment you register in our online
