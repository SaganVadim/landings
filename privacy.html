                    <h3>Protecting Our Customers' Information</h3>
                    <p>
                      At GreenVolt, we recognize the significance of privacy for
                      all our customers. We are committed to responsibly
                      managing the personal information of each individual who
                      utilizes our services, with special regard for those under
                      18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data
                      from minors and request that such details not be provided
                      to us. In the event that such information is inadvertently
                      collected without parental consent, it will be immediately
                      removed from our records. Furthermore, we ensure that our
                      employees and outsourced service providers do not share
                      personal information beyond the scope necessary to provide
                      the requested services, unless explicit consent from the
                      data owner has been granted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our commitment to privacy is an integral part of our
                      pledge to the quality and excellence of the services we
                      offer. We do not create data processing systems for
                      commercial purposes unless expressly requested by the data
                      subject. When asked to provide personal information, we
                      will send detailed information on how and why we are
                      collecting and using that information. When consent is
                      required, we appreciate your attention to the privacy
                      safeguards that we are implementing.

                    <h3>Data Retention and Security</h3>
                    <p>
                      The personal data you entrust to us is managed with utmost
                      care. GreenVolt retains this information for as long as
                      necessary to provide the excellent service you expect from
                      us, or as current legislation requires. Our retention
                      periods consider the nature and sensitivity of the data,
                      the potential risk of unauthorized use or disclosure, and
                      whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
                      always ensuring your privacy. We have adopted physical,
                      technical, and administrative measures to safeguard your
                      information. These measures include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Secure data storage on our servers.</li>
                      <li>
                        State-of-the-art encryption for in-transit protection.
                      </li>
                      <li>Strict policies and access control procedures.</li>
                      <li>
                        Regular training to ensure staff security competence.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ongoing monitoring and updates to our protective
                        technologies.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Our dedication to privacy extends beyond data retention.
                      It also includes transparency in data collection and use,
                      guaranteeing that you are fully informed about when and
                      how your information is collected, processed, and
                      utilized. By providing your personal details, you give us
                      express consent for collection, storage, processing, and
                      use for the purpose of providing top-level services.

                    <h3>Global Standards for Local Services</h3>
                    <p>
                      In our global community, your personal information may be
                      processed outside of your country of origin; however, we
                      maintain our promise of protection wherever your
                      information flows. This includes implementing effective
                      safeguards and ensuring that international processing
                      complies with the strict standards established in our
                      privacy policy. GreenVolt adheres to international privacy
                      standards, such as the EU's General Data Protection
                      Regulation (GDPR), and stays abreast of legal and
                      regulatory changes that could affect the protection of
                      your data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      GreenVolt also works closely with partners and
                      contractors, ensuring that they too adopt appropriate
                      privacy measures and respect their commitments to our
                      clients. With this focus, our customers' personal
                      information is treated with the same dignity and respect,
                      regardless of where it is processed.
