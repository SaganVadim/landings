                        Step into the world of GiftBoutiq with our initial
                        exploration session. This immersive experience, lasting
                        up to 1 hour, is a crucial opportunity for us to assess
                        compatibility and determine if we're the perfect match
                        for your gifting needs. There's absolutely no obligation
                        for you to commit to choosing gifts from us, but we
                        believe this session will showcase the unique qualities
                        that set GiftBoutiq apart.<br /><br />During this
                        initial consultation, we'll encourage you to share your
                        preferences, the reasons motivating your gift search,
                        and any specific themes or occasions you have in mind.
                        We'll delve into your past gift-giving experiences,
                        current preferences, and your aspirations for finding
                        that perfect gift. Based on our discussion, we'll craft
                        a preliminary understanding of your gifting needs and
                        propose potential options from our curated collection.
                        You'll have ample time to ask any questions you might
                        have about the gifts we offer.<br /><br />As we conclude
                        this session, we'll invite you to take some time to
                        reflect on whether GiftBoutiq aligns with your vision
                        for unique and thoughtful gifts. If you choose to
                        continue, our next step would be guiding you through the
                        exciting process of selecting the perfect gifts from our
                        exclusive collection.

                      The timeframe for our delightful journey into the world of
                      unique gifts is customized for each individual, ranging
                      from a few browsing sessions to more extensive,
                      longer-term gift exploration. Following our initial
                      assessment of your preferences, I'll estimate the number
                      of sessions I believe could enhance your gifting
                      experience. Together, we'll decide on this based on our
                      agreed-upon gift-giving goals. Regardless of our initial
                      plan, it's important to note that the arrangement remains
                      open to reevaluation.<br /><br />This flexibility is
                      essential due to potential discoveries that may surface
                      during our gift exploration and the possibility of shifts
                      in your gifting objectives. For example, you might
                      initially seek assistance in finding the perfect birthday
                      present, and we might set a goal of 6 sessions to
                      accomplish this task. However, as our gift exploration
                      progresses, other occasions or recipients could come to
                      light, like an upcoming wedding or a friend who deserves a
                      thoughtful surprise. At this point, we can collaboratively
                      decide whether to extend our gift exploration to include
                      these additional occasions and determine the number of
                      sessions required for thoughtful gift selection.

                    <p>
                      Individual gift selection sessions commence at $20 per
                      session. For personalized gift consultation, my rate is
                      $50 per hour. GiftBoutiq is affiliated with various gift
                      insurance providers like SurpriseGuard. To clarify gift
                      referral procedures, I recommend reaching out to your gift
                      insurance provider. Moreover, I provide a limited number
                      of sessions at reduced fees for special occasions or bulk
                      gift orders. Feel free to get in touch to discuss
                      availability and explore this option further.
